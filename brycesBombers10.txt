HingleMcCringleberry vs. The Belidicks:
In week 10’s race for mediocrity, 12th place HingleMcCringleberry was beat out by 9th place The Belidicks. The Belidicks’s AJ Green managed to get his head out of the WWE ring and led the receiver core with 17.50 points, while HingleMcCringleberry’s bench was best bench with what could have been the matchup winning 10.10 points from Sammy Watkins. Sad!

Silver Bullets vs. I am the Kareem:
In his matchup with now 11th place Silver Bullets, our fearless supreme leader and commissioner I am the Kareem stayed in 2nd place in the league with his expected crushing surprising upset of Silver Bullets. However, it was a day of underperformance and disappointment (that’s what she said), as Silver Bullets’ RB Dion Lewis lead the entire pack with a whole 17.50 points. However, again Silver Bullets benched what would have been the matchup winning Jared Goff with a massive 26.50 from 355 passing yards and 3 TDs. This isn’t golf, you want more points not less. Pro tip.
 
Gronkowski’s Honorable Mention of the Week:
West Coast Browns with 69.24 points. Nice.
