        Comrade Nesty's Manifesto
    </h2>
    <p style="margin:10px; font-size: 10px;">
    <strong>Championship Battle:</strong><br>
Bryce lost this game because he is appropriating scientific facts that the Motherland was first to discover, i.e. Black Holes, the Singularity, the Russian manned landing of the moon of June 9, 1969 which has been erased from history by the filthy imperialists! Uke has made it fairly to the finals, by doing the most in the league this year to lend a helping hand to the peasants playing against him by starting players who get 0 points or not starting players in positions at all.<br>
Colin beats Jacob because he continues to honor Kareem, one of the Motherland’s greatest adopted sons, and because Jacob’s country of origin has failed to fully embrace the teachings of our Lord and Savior Karl Marx.<br>
This sets up a final for the ages, but it is Uke’s destiny to be victorious given he worked so hard all season to be more equal to his opponents, and given that he rides the coattails of Todd Gurley. Todd is a critical member of the Motherland’s favorite team which selflessly left its comfortable confines of St Louis to venture to LA and make it more equal for visiting teams since their fans approximately equal the number of Rams fans in the stadium each week. Colin bows out honorably, scoring exactly 69.00 points.<br>

<br><strong>Jamba Juice Bowl:</strong><br>
The day Jimbo adopted those imperialist pigs the other team from Manchester and “The” Ohio State as his mascots, was the day this season unraveled for him. Like Hitler learned when he decided to backstab and attack us, sooner or later you will lose. The Motherland never forgets, Jimbo. Aleck was our secret weapon.<br>
John is the most consistent attacker of me in the group thread, leading with a whopping 69% of caused triggerings. He also caused my first meltdown of the season when I did better than my projection only to lose to him by 5 points (before I knew that was a common occurrence). The Motherland came back for him and his big nose twice in the past 3 weeks, winning the battle of who is the most equal 7-7 team.<br>
The Motherland must continue to allow our esteemed undercover warrior “Kap” to cause division among the filthy imperialists. My players will therefore purposefully bow out of the Jamba Juice Bowl and be the most equal of all teams by finishing with the most points for, yet an 8-8 record, with our son Kareem resuming his mid-season slump, Fashion Chairman Cam Newton having one of his classic off days, and kicker and Deputy Leader Harrison Butlicker getting the most points on the team.<br>

<br><strong>Sacko:</strong><br>
The Motherland has no beef with Sean, but Blake has been selflessly spreading the Communist gospel everywhere. The Motherland treasures Blake’s commitment to the Little Red Book along his travels, and so felt it was necessary to save him from the Sacko.<br>
The other Sacko game was a similar story, however replace Sean with Kyle and Blake with Billbo, and flip Billbo from selfless soldier to enemy of the Motherland. Kyle has had little to say against me in the group thread, probably because he hasn’t actually met me yet. Will is the Motherland’s enemy for reasons you can read below. Kyle was saved, Will’s headed for the Sacko.<br>
Sean has caused the least amount of my triggerings in the group with only 0.69%, and champions the peasants by having 4 players who cannot play on his bench. Meanwhile, Billbo showed me no mercy in week 11, defeating me by the most number of points this season and with the most points he scored all season. He even added insult to injury by starting a receiver who was out for the game. The Motherland hates Billbo Baggins and how he steals from the poor defenseless Gollum, and so Will must be punished with the 2017 Sacko.<br>

<br><strong>(Special Segment) Gulag Prisoners:</strong><br>
Martavis Bryant: One of my first picks, decided he wanted to do him and leave the Steelers who then dropped him. He wasted valuable resources in a pick and starting position for weeks. There is no such thing as individualism in the Motherland, we only work for the collective good here. Gulag for you.<br>
Devonte Parker: “Oh hey, my team is losing 20-0 to the Jets so let me just get 10 GARBAGE TIME POINTS by scoring a touchdown after which we don’t even have time to kick an extra point because the game is over.” Such ambition is frowned upon here. This caused the massive meltdown and now legendary “App Deletion-Gate”. Traitor to the Motherland. Gulag for you.<br>
Blair Walsh: He looks like he wears makeup. And can’t kick a ball. Both of these are completely contrary to what the Motherland stands for. Gulag for you.<br>
JuJu Smith-Schuster: It’s hard to do this to him because he’s such a fun character, but there is no room for sentiment in the Motherland. He was the reason I changed my team name to “Voodoo Mama JuJu” which preceded a 1-5 run that ruined my playoff hopes before I changed it back. Gulag for you.<br>
Baltimore Defense: They did well the few times I played them, except when they went to London and proceeded to lose 44-7 to JACKSONVILLE, getting -4 points and costing me a net 15 points. To be fair, nobody knew Jacksonville would actually be good. But the Motherland doesn’t care about hindsight or it’s 20/20 vision. Gulag for all of you.<br>
Yahoo Fantasy Staff: Typical imperialist liars and spies, giving me false hope with an A+ draft ranking and the most PF in the league yet proceeding to stop me reaching the playoffs via weekly triggerings and letting my team only shine once it was impossible to make the playoffs. OFF TO THE GULAG FOR ALL OF YOU.
