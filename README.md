fantasy football league notice board


Working on a 'territory map' but not sure if it makes sense for fantasy football since someone will own the whole thing. Works for CFB because many teams dont cross paths, so the county map stays divided

Began in python using a vega wrapper but wran into issues and it would randomly blow itself up. Now migrating it to javascript and trying to make it work there

Also working on a simulation to discover a method that prevents someone from taking over the whole country in a normal ff season
