    Twas the night before misfitmas, when all through the league,<br>

    not a person was watching, we are crippled by fatigue.<br>

    The lineups were picked through pain and dispair,<br>

    Hoping that ACLs this week will not tear.<br>

    <br>

    Gone AB, gone Wentz, gone Rodgers, Legatron too,<br>

    Gone Watson, gone DJ, gone Beckham with boo-boo’s.<br>

    This year has been brutal, our roster’s all dead<br>

    so listen while I cherish you all instead:

    “He wants to play” Bryce said, “its a sight to be seen!”<br>

    But nervous we were, Bryce was the worst there has been.<br>

    From Sactown you hail but we wouldnt know,<br>

    You fit right in the league like ducks in a row.<br>

    <br>

    I hope you return, play with us next year<br>

    hashtag fisting emoji is a team all should fear.<br>

    You’ve been a good sport and got all our jokes<br>

    I hope you’re not scared, or think us indecent folks.<br>

    Snowflakes are falling on this christmas eve<br>

    Some weeks I fear Nesty’s forgotten to breathe<br>

    We’ve triggered many tantrums that tear you apart<br>

    But forever you’ll be first place in our hearts

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Sean, my good boy, now a man since marriage<br>

    you hopped off your trophy and boarded loser’s carriage.<br>

    You abandoned the patriots and points you’ve been draining,<br>

    for the Sacko you fight I hope you’ve been training

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    “I’m a pro!” he shouted, “this is my 8th team!”<br>

    His record makes jeff Fisher’s eyes twinkle and gleam<br>

    Slow down on the waiver it does you no favor<br>

    Good luck against family, maybe first you will savor

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Your brother is a kicker, you should know the game,<br>

    but this season your team was empty and lame.<br>

    Yet here you now sit, on the eve of great battle<br>

    Maybe a victory and trophy you’ll be able to rattle!

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    “West coast browns!” you proclaimed, “they are the worst”<br>

    Your shouting echoed from Mt Tam to castle of Hearst.<br>

    But now things are new, a big time trade was made;<br>

    Calm your wild heart, don’t throw Jimmy Grapes no shade

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    “Im in Nola” you said, “life is so great!”<br>

    Then Brady, your hero, barely cleared eight.<br>

    In the sacko you are, I hope your defeat is near<br>

    Because then we can see you, I miss you quite dear

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Green text, oh green text. I forget that you play<br>

    I hope you like android, but for an iPhone we pray<br>

    You had half the league hoping you lost<br>

    but cold was year heart, worse than Jack Frost

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    A region of spacetime with such massive gravity<br>

    not even the light spectrum can escape your depravity.<br>

    A black hole you became and swallowed us all<br>

    then choked on an Big Apples, the king doth fall

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Walsh you did give us, please take him back<br>

    I beg, I plead, before I suffer a heart attack.<br>

    Playing better than Brady is your third string QB<br>

    How sweet a home superbowl trophy would be

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Blake, Balackeh, white thunder to some<br>

    drafting Zeke and his diddling looked very dumb.<br>

    But in spades it will pay off, to have him at last<br>

    For the final game he will play, oh what a blast.

    <img src="garland.png", style="height:25px", class="garland"/>

    Now a message for ye, from your supreme leader;<br>

    friendships weve made, even when scores do teeter.<br>

    A great season we’ve had and meltdowns weve triggered,<br>

    Pride and dignity each week left horribly disfigured.<br>

    <br>

    Don’t let this feeling leave, of friendship and fun<br>

    don’t let the text thread and die if football is done.<br>

    There’s baseball and soccer and playoffs too<br>

    we can crash at John’s house and make it a zoo.<br>

    <br>

    A family weve become, of bickering and jest<br>

    12 brothers in arms fighting to be the best<br>

    one day left for these games, its the end of the fight<br>

    HAPPY MISFITMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!
