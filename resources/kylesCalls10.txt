Manaconda vs. I Am the Kareem
Loser: I Am The Kareem 
Why: Julio Jones and Gronk literally won't show up, and Manaconda's Russell Wilson will have the game of the season. Plus, Kareem doesn't even have Kareem anymore. 

D1 Bound vs. I Got Big Apples
Loser: D1 Bound 
Why: Minnesota's defense will outscore D1 Bound's Matt Ryan. Period. 

Points Singularity vs. Silver Bullets
Loser: Points Singularity
Why: Contrarian vote for the underdog. Silver Bullets appears to be keeping the faith in Zeke's lawyers as of mid-week. I sense a miracle in the works for Bullets.
