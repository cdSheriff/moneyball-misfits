			<h1>Black Hole Phenomenon in Fantasy Football</h1>
			<h2>Abstract:</h2>
			<p>
				Jimbo Slice is made of dark matter. His reign as 'fantasy black hole' is undisputed, based on all three tested metrics: points against, variation from projected score, and variation from mean score. Eli's Poopy Daiper is a minor body dwarfed by Jimbo Slice's gravitational pull. HingleMcCringleberry through all three metrics continues to be the 'fantasy giving tree'.

			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<p>
				Historical data shows that Jimbo Slice is made of dark matter and is a 'fantasy black hole'. This theory was challenged by Eli's Poopy Daiper in previous seasons, but this report shows Jimbo Slice to be the true 'fantasy black hole' through several metrics. Additionally through this report we show that HingleMcCringleberry is the 'fantasy giving tree' through all metrics.

			<h2>Glossary of terms:</h2>
			<p>
				Fantasy black hole:	Every team that faces this menace has their soul sucked through their face as their team shits the bed
			<br>
				Fantasy giving tree: This team doles out points to opponents like a college health center shares condoms. Usually at his own expense
			</p>

			<h2>Methodology:</h2>
			<p>
				A preliminary review for previous research regarding the phenomenon of a 'fantasy black hole' uncovered few results. Previously the therm has applied to: a fantasy football league comprised of Oakland Raiders fans, a nickname given to Amari Cooper by analysists, and the horribleness that was the TE landscape in the 2017 fantasy football season. Therefore the author will propose the methodology for finding and proving the existance of a 'fantasy black hole' in a fantasy football league:
			</p>
			<h4>1. Points Against</h4>
			<p>
				The simplest and most common of methods, points against can be performed by even an autodrafter or QB-in-first-round drafter. No, A-a-ron will not take you to the championship. Sit the fuck down. While most analysis of points against is the total, because that is what the league scoreboard shows, this report uses the mean, because statistical terms look fancy. The lower the score, the stronger the 'fantasy black hole'.
			</p>
			<h4>2. Deviation from Projected</h4>
			<p>
				This is a deeper dive into a team's performance against the 'fantasy black hole'. If a team is a 'fantasy black hole', do they really manage to suck points away from their opponents? Do they have a low points against because they play shitty teams, or do the teams they face fall flat when playing the 'fantasy black hole'? The more negative the score, the stronger the 'fantasy black hole'.
			</p>
			<h4>3. Deviation from Mean</h4>
			<p>
				Similar to deviation from projected, this is intended to prove that the 'fantasy black hole' doesn't just play shit teams. Each team's season score is averaged, and then subtracted from their score against the 'fantasy black hole'. The more negative the score, the stronger the 'fantasy black hole'.

				Your girlfriend may pretend to like fantasy football, but she just does it so you can brag around the watercooler that your girlfriend is 'cool' and 'one of the guys'. She also drafted Jimmy Galapagos in the first round 'because he is just so handsome!' Get real dude. Also do some harder hitting analysis than just sorting by points against. Either way, Jimbo Slice is the 'fantasy black hole'.
			</p>

			<h4>2. Deviation from Projected</h4>

				Average projected score entering the week hovers around 100 in a standard twelve team league. Given this year's insane QB play and the NFL becoming a CFL air raid, scores are blowing out projection all over (except in our shit league). The true test of a 'fantasy black hole' is making sure they actually cause teams to implode. according to the analysis, teams score 15% less than expected against Jimbo Slice, making him the clear 'fantasy black hole'.
			</p>

			<h4>3. Deveation from Mean</h4>

				'The Jets are actually good dude, they won three games in a row!' is what Uke said last year. First of all, you only like football because it gets you free rent. Second of all, two of their wins were against the Dolphins and the Browns. They went 2-9 for the remainder of that season. Sidetracking aside, all of this is to point out that strength of schedule is important to consider before crowning a team 'fantasy black hole'. By comparing how the opponent performs against the 'fantasy black hole' compared to the rest of the league, we can rule out any strength of schedule factors. Teams score almost 20 fewer points against the 'fantasy black hole' compared to playing other teams, which is abysmal. Jimbo Slice is the 'fantasy black hole'.

			<h2>Additional Findings:</h2>
			<p>
				While this whole report has focused on the 'fantasy black hole', it is important to also look at the other side of the wormhole, the 'fantasy giving tree'. Popularized by the Shel Silverstein book, the giving tree sacrifices itself in order to provide for someone else. HingleMcCringleberry has been the 'fantasy giving tree', and his generousity has resulted in three losses so far. His only win came against his holiness the Supreme Commissioner, but he got a D- for his draft so his team is utter garbage.
